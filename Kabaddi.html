<b><h1><center>A Short Note on Kabaddi- The Sport</center></h1></b>
<b><h4>While writing a  Kabaddi essay in English, we must make use of resources to gather relevant information about the sport. <br>Kabaddi is a team sport that requires seven players in two teams<br> The aim of the sport is for a single player on offense to run into the opposing team’s court up to an extent and then tag out as many defenders of the opponent team as possible and return to the respective court anyhow without getting touched. To play this game it is essential to have a wide field of 10-13 meters long.<br> It is played for approximately 20 minutes.<br> Like any other game, the toss-winning team plays first in Kabaddi.<br> The points are given based on the tagged players and also on stopping the raider. It seems like there is nothing more thrilling and exciting than watching a game of Kabaddi.<br> The players, it is to be noted, are selected based on body weight and age. </h4></b>

<b><h1><center>Method of Playing</center></h1></b>
<b><h3>In this part of the essay on Kabaddi, how to play Kabaddi is mainly focussed upon. When this game starts, one of the team’s players chants the word “Kabaddi” and tags the player from the opponent team and returns to his court. If the players from the opponent team stop the player in their court, then the player who tried to tag automatically gets disqualified. This might sound simple but it's pretty difficult and requires a lot of energy to play. A similar exhibition of energy and competition is seen in the Kabaddi World Cup which must be mentioned in any 10 lines about Kabaddi or 5 lines on Kabaddi. Kabaddi information in an English essay would include the fact that to date India is the most successful team in this competition.</h3></b>
